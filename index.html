                    <p>It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. We have a fantastic little sky! Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.<p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Section Two</h4>
                <div class="accordion-content accordion-content-hidden">
                    <p>We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Section Three</h4>
                <div class="accordion-content accordion-content-hidden">
                    <p>You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. In your world you can create anything you desire. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content accordion-content-hidden">
                    <p>Just use the old one inch brush. Just let these leaves jump off the brush You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Isn't that fantastic? We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.<p>
